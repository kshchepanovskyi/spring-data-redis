  <title>Connector features</title>
  
  <para>Unfortunately, currently, not all connectors support all Redis features.  When invoking a method on the <interfacename>Connection</interfacename> API that is unsupported by the underlying library, a <classname>UnsupportedOperationException</classname>
  is thrown.
  This situation is likely to be fixed in the future, as the various connectors mature.
